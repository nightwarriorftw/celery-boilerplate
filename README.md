## :beginner: About

This is a simple django celery boilerplate. 

Celery is a simple, flexible, and reliable distributed system to process vast amounts of messages, while providing operations with the tools required to maintain such a system.

Itâ€™s a task queue with focus on real-time processing, while also supporting task scheduling.

### :wrench: Built

Built using django, celery, rabbitMQ


### :nut_and_bolt: Installation

####  Virtual Environment
In this step we will setup a virtual environment. For this boilerplate project I have used **poetry** which is generally used for managing
packages of your project.

- Install poetry using this 
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python3
```

- Setup the virtual environment
```
poetry env use python3.9
```

- Activate this virtual environment
```
source <path to your virtual env>/bin/activate
``` 
Generally, <path to the virtual env> is `/home/<username>/.cache/pypoetry/virtualenvs/<name of your virtual env>`

- Install requirements

While remaining inside source code root folder run :
```
poetry install
```

#### Setup RABBITMQ

```
sudo apt-get install rabbitmq-server`
sudo rabbitmqctl add_user myuser mypassword
sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / myuser ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

- Make sure that these celery configuration are added in your `settings.py` and update *myuser* and *mypassword* there

```
    BROKER_URL = 'amqp://myuser:mypassword@127.0.0.1:5672//'
    CELERY_ACCEPT_CONTENT = ['json']
    CELERY_TASK_SERIALIZER = 'json'
    CELERY_RESULT_SERIALIZER = 'json'
    CELERY_TIMEZONE = 'Asia/Kolkata'
    CELERY_IMPORTS = ('api.tasks',)
```

#### Makemigrations, migrate and run the server

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

#### Run server

```
python manage.py runserver
```

#### Celery

Open another terminal and run the following command 

```
celery -A celery_boilerplate worker -l info

```

Now in order to test open django shell `python manage.py shell` and run the following command

```
from fun_app.tasks import add
add.delay(10, 20)
```
Now you will observe the results in the terminal in which celery is running
